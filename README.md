All tasks are written by the teacher.

### TASK1
***Task description:***
> Create a Crow’s Foot ERD for each of the following descriptions.
MG Builders Company is a multi-state building contractor specializing in medium-priced town homes. Assume that MG Builders main entities are its customers, employees, projects and equipment. A customer can hire the company for more than one project, and employees sometimes work on more than one project at a time. Equipment, however, is assigned to only one project at a time. Draw an ERD showing those entities.

### TASK2
***Task description:***
> Create system ERD (entity relationships diagram) using Crow’s Foot/Martin/Information Engineering style. In your ERD must be minimum 10 entities.

### TASK3
***Task description:***
> **Moodle access needed for the table**. The Public Safety office at Millennium College maintains a list of parking tickets issued to vehicles parked illegally on the campus. Table 1 shows a portion of this list for the fall semester. (Attribute names are abbreviated to conserve space.)
Convert this table to a relation in first normal form by entering appropriate data in the table. What are the determinants in this relation?
Draw a dependency diagram that shows all functional dependencies in the relation, based on the sample data shown.
Give an example of one or more anomalies that can result in using this relation.
Develop a set of relations in third normal form. Include a new column with the heading Violation in the appropriate table to explain the reason for each ticket. Values in this column are: expired parking meter (ticket code 1), no parking permit (ticket code 2), and handicap violation (ticket code 3).

### TASK4
***Task description:***
> Create database. The topic can be chosen by yourself. The creation of a database consists of these steps: 
1. Create ERD using Crow‘s Foot/Martin/Information Engineering style. In ERD must  be minimum 7 entities. 
2. Convert ERD to relational model. Describe every transformation step. 
3. Using normalization forms on your relational model. Describe every normalization step.

### TASK5
***Task description:***
> In exercise 4 we created a database relational model. Create database with queries (using CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements) based on relational model from exercise 4.
Fill the database with data (using INSERT statement). Minimum 3 records for each table.

### TASK6
***Task description:***
> **Moodle access needed for this task** This task was completed using local college database.
